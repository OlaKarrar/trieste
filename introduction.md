#### The ethics of data: algorithm design

* There are increasing concerns that uncritical design of algorithms are
perpetuating cultural stereotypes.
* How can we raise awareness of programmes and algorithms that
perpetuate cultural stereotypes or injustices?
	* Googleâ€™s online advertising system, for instance, showed an ad
      for high-income jobs to men much more often than it showed the
      ad to women, as demonstrated by a study by Carnegie Mellon
      University researchers.
